///// About

costEstimatr is a very simple jQuery plugin that I created to easily allow anyone who offers a service to provide a real-time cost estimate to their users. In a nutshell, this plugin allows you to add the value attribute of all checkboxes, radio buttons and select form elements (as long as you have set it to a number which represents the price) and outputs a cost estimate as well as an optional estimate on the number of days it will take to complete the project.
